A Python module for accessing CTA Bus Tracker information

================================================================================

About:
This implements all of the methods available in the Chicago Transit Authority
Bus Tracker API (see http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/bustracker.aspx for
more information)

Tutorial:
TODO

TODO:
 * Documentation: This README, as well as pydoc in the code
 * Working around the weirdness in the spec. Like page 28 and the 
   affectedservice object, why would you have nothing in there
   EXCEPT the name of the stop?
 * Testing against the API, as the documentation doesn't match up
   with the results often.
 * Logging: More performance and debugging logging as necessary
 * Error handling: Errors returned from the CTA API will be silently ignored or
   throw an unexpected exception, should pass those out as necessary
 * Caching: Shouldn't make a request against the API more than once every 60 
   seconds, as the data on the API only updates that frequently
 * Utility methods: Calculating distance between two points on a route
 * Coherency: There's some weirdness in the BusTracker API that exists here,
   particularly with terse ("A" for arrival and "D" for departure) or verbose
   ("West Bound") string handling. This should probably be more consistent.
 * __str__() methods: Ugly.
 * General cleanup: It's been a while since I've written anything in Python, a
   lot of this code is just a mess.
